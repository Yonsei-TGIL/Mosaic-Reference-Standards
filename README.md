Introduction
------------
A robust pipeline for constructing mosaic reference standards. The reference standards are consisting of XXXX mosaic SNVs and INDELs in a wide range of variant allele frequencies, from 0.1% to 56%. Negative controls of wild-type positions and germline vairants are accompanied with abundant positive controls. The reference stands were constructed by mixing genetic materials of pre-genotped, six normal cell lines

## Genotyping six cell lines

#### 1. Genotyping Methods
  - Strelka2 
  - DeepVariant 
  - CNVkit   
  
#### 2. Generating candiates 
  - Positive controls 
    + mutually exclusive germline variants    
    
  - Negative controls   
    + common reference homozygous positions (Set A)   
    + MRC5 germine variants (Set B)   
    
## Post-filtrations
